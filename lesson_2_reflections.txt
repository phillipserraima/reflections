What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It takes a snapshot of the files and creates a logging system for GIT to work.
We need it so GIT can log the commits done.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging is a test area before going into the final area.
It offers you the chance to make sure everything is good before going live.
