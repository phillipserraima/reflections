When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you want to work in collaboration with other people or from different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There might be times where you are working on files that do not need to be updated yet. So automatically staying up to date with the remote might overwrite this.
